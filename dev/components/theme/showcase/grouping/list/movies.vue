              Building a Bridge
            </u-item-tile>
            <u-item-tile sublabel lines="5">
              A bridge is one of those things that are often taken for granted until you don’t have one,
              especially if you live on a rural property and there’s a creek between your house and the
              county road. John Doe had plans to build a new bridge along with building a new house on
              his property, but plans for the bridge were made top priority when a wayward truck carried
              too much weight over the old bridge and it collapsed.
